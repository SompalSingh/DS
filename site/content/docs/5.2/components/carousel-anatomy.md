Carousels show a collection of items one at a time. They are also known as “slideshows” and “sliders”. Typical uses of carousels include scrolling news headlines, featured articles on home pages, and image galleries.

## 1. Best Practice
<div class="mt-24"></div>

- Appears toward the top of the homepage
- Occupies a substantial section of the “above fold” area
- Displays more than one piece of content in the same place (one at a time)
- Offers some indication (or navigation) that there is more than one piece of featured content, or frame, within the carousel
- Contains images and a small amount of text in each frame
- Includes content about the organization’s brand or mission, featured information, or consists of promotions.

## 2. Content guidelines
<div class="mt-24"></div>

- Include 5 or fewer frames within the carousel, as it’s unlikely users will engage with more than that. It can be taxing to swipe through many frames on a mobile device, and it’s difficult for users to recognize topics they have already viewed when a set exceeds about five. Limiting the number also helps with discovering the content, and finding the content in the carousel again later.
- Use crisp-looking text and images that coincide with the organization’s charter. It’s difficult to read small text and decipher small images, especially on mobile devices. And it’s never any good to cram a large, high-density image into a small region. The clearer the text and images, the more likely users are to engage and understand the intended points.
- Indicate how many frames are present and where the user is within the progression, to help people feel in control.
- Use icons and links that are understandable and recognizable. In navigation controls, aim to help people identify the choices, and recall them after they have already seen the content in the main frame.
- Ensure that navigation controls appear inside the carousel, not below it or separated by a fold.
- If offering a navigation button for each frame (rather than arrows to scroll through), ensure that each button looks different, and represents the frame.
- Make links and buttons large enough to decipher and click. Buttons that are tiny, close together, or on top of a busy background are not easy to notice or click.



## 3. Accessibility
<div class="mt-24"></div>

- Users must be able to pause carousel movement because it can be too fast or distracting, making text hard to read.
- All functionality, including navigating between carousel items, must be operable by keyboard
- Changes to carousel items must be communicated to all users, including screen reader users.
- The keyboard position (“focus”) is managed in a reasonable and comprehensible fashion.
